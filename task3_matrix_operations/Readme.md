Objective-The objective of this task is to develop a Python-based Matrix Operations Tool using the NumPy library. The tool allows users to input matrices and perform common matrix operations through an interactive, menu-driven interface.

Features-The tool supports the following matrix operations:
Matrix Addition
Matrix Subtraction
Matrix Multiplication
Matrix Transpose
Matrix Determinant (for square matrices only)

Tools and Libraries Used-
Python
NumPy

How the Tool Works-
The user specifies the number of rows and columns.
The user inputs values for two matrices.
A menu is displayed with available operations.
Based on the user’s selection, the corresponding matrix operation is performed.
The result is displayed in a structured format.
The program includes basic validation, such as checking whether a matrix is square before calculating the determinant.

Sample Workflow-
User enters matrix dimensions.
User inputs matrix values row by row.
User selects an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, or determinant).
The program computes and displays the result using NumPy functions.
